README: swisscovery customization package

This repository contains the latest version of swisscovery' customization package (https://swisscovery.slsp.ch/).

Directives and modules are also added to the central customizations package avery 2-3 sprints. IZs which maintain and manage their customization package themselves can take the elements they need to customize their local package out of it and integrate them in their IZ customization package or wait for the update of the central customization package.

The "not broswerified version" folder contains codes for IZs that do nhot inherit the central customization package and don't use browserify option. From here IZs can copy paste these codes in their custom.js file.

New elements implemented in this package are announced via blogpost in SLSPhere.
