README: swisscovery customization package

This repository contains the latest version of the network zone customization package of swisscovery (https://swisscovery.slsp.ch/)

IZs which maintain and manage their customization package themselves can take the elements they need to customize their local package out of it and integrate them in their IZ customization package.

The "not broswerified version" folder contains codes for IZs that don't use browserify option. From here IZs can copy paste these codes in their custom.js file.

New elements implemented in this package are announced via blogpost in SLSPhere.

Last update of the swisscovery customization package: 13.12.2022
