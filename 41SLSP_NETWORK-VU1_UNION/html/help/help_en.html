                    <p>
                        The Swiss Library Service Platform, along with his subsidiary Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries, with more than
                        <a href="https://slsp.ch/libraries" target="_blank">490 members</a>, is the biggest network of academic and research libraries in Switzerland. Created by libraries, for libraries, it is a joint effort to provide a series of services at the entire country such as, a shared multilingual catalogue of scientific information, a unique representative for e-resources licensing and a performant courier network for physical items sharing.
                    </p>
                    <p>SLSP represents an innovative and significant step forward in the digital evolution of scientific libraries in Switzerland. By managing the cloud-based Alma system, the organisation brings together scientific information stored in libraries across Switzerland. By making this information accessible and easily findable, SLSP contributes to scientific discovery and progress.</p>

                        <h3>SLSP Network<img class="icon_up2" height="20" width="15" src="custom/41SLSP_NETWORK-CENTRAL_PACKAGE/img/help/iconUp.png" /> </h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>SLSP Network is divided in several "zones".  SLSP itself manage the network zone (NZ) called swisscovery, while libraries have been distributed in 29 "institution zones" (IZ).</p>
                    <p>An institution zone (IZ) is a group of libraries that have similar needs. The IZ is a key component in the SLSP system and represents a division that enables synergies and increases efficiency. In SLSP we distinguish two types of institution zone: single entity zones and mixed entity zones.</p>
                    <p>In a single entity zone, most of libraries are legally related to one main entity (for instance a university). In a mixed entity zone, libraries are legally related to different entities (for instance they are grouped together due to geographical considerations)</p>
                    <p>To access the resources of SLSP members, users must access the users' interfaces called "views". In SLSP we have prepared a view for the Network Zone (NZ), a view for every Institution Zone (IZ) and several views for single libraries.</p>
                    <p>Every view has its specifics search scopes, which will return different results when used for the search. The swisscovery network zone contains all records coming from the SLSP libraries, some general external resource (for example e-rara data) and the CDI index. The institution zones views and the library views contain the local inventory of the institution zone / library, general and local external resources and the CDI index.</p>
                    <p>Central Discovery Index (CDI): is a central database of more than 3 billion of records such as: journals articles, e-books, dissertations, conference proceedings, etc.</p>

                        Access to online resources often depends on whether your device is within the network of a licensing university and if you work for or study at this university. Some universities and libraries allow users to access online resources from outside their network using a proxy service. For more information concerning the conditions to access the online resources, you can consult the chapter "Online resources" of this help page,
                        the <a href="https://consortium.ch/?lang=en" target="_blank">Consortium's website</a>  or the website of the library which licenses for the respective resource.
                    </p>
                    <p>These conditions aren't applied to the National licences (for more information see the corresponding chapter of this help page). </p>

Before placing a request, swisscovery recommends checking if the publication is available in another institution, under “Other loan and request options”.

                    <p><strong>swisscovery:</strong></p> 
					<p>Within the library platform swisscovery around <a href="https://registration.slsp.ch/libraries/" target="_blank">490 academic libraries</a> from all over Switzerland have joined forces. The search portal of the same name allows users to search not only the physical media holdings, but also a wide range of electronic resources such as databases, newspapers, digital objects, articles and journals. Thanks to the central user account via the <a href="https://www.switch.ch/edu-id/" target="_blank">SWITCH edu-ID</a>, this content from all libraries can not only be searched, but also borrowed, reserved, delivered nationwide via digitization order, courier or postal delivery, or accessed directly in full text online with just one registration.</p>
					<p><strong>My library:</strong></p> 
					<p>You only want to search the holdings of your favorite local library? No problem, after conducting a search you will find filter options on the left to narrow down your results to a single library or a specific region, so that only results from their physical and electronic media collection are presented. In case some of the items are currently unavailable at your local library, you will find an information whether they can be retrieved from another library within the large swisscovery network in the detailed view of each result under "other loan and request options".</p>
					<p><strong>E-Resources:</strong></p> 
					<p>In swisscovery you can find not only printed media, but also search for a wide array of open access and licensed digital media collections. All electronic databases, journals, daily newspapers, articles, film, and audio streaming services offered by swisscovery libraries can be searched and found here. Access to individual electronic resources may be restricted to members of a particular university or residents of a particular canton, depending on the license conditions of the provider. To have accurate information about what is available, it is recommended to login with your account in swisscovery.</p>
					<p><strong>Physical resources:</strong></p> 
					<p>In swisscovery you can find all media, which the participating libraries have in their holdings on site. In addition to printed media such as books, magazines, and newspapers, this also includes other physical media such as images, film, and sound recordings, as well as precious manuscripts, old prints, letters, bequests, and maps.</p>
					<p><strong>Digital objects:</strong></p> 
					<p>The valuable holdings from the swisscovery libraries with special and historical collections are extensively digitized, indexed and prepared for immediate online use. In addition to books, journals and newspapers, these may also include manuscripts, letters, old prints as well as archive holdings and bequests from platforms such as e-rara, e-manuscripta and e-codices, all of which can also be searched and accessed on swisscovery.</p>
					<p><strong>Consortium resources:</strong></p> 
					<p>The <a href="https://consortium.ch/?lang=en" target="_blank">consortium of Swiss university libraries</a> acquires licenses for scientific resources (electronic journals, e-books and databases), which can also be searched on swisscovery. These include the so-called <a href="https://consortium.ch/nationallizenzen/?lang=en" target="_blank">national licenses</a>, which are available in full text not only to researchers, students and university staff, but also to all private users with permanent residence in Switzerland.</p>
					<p><strong>Institutional repositories:</strong></p> 
					<p>Many universities make their researchers' and students' papers and theses freely available to the general and scientifically interested public in <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/digitalisation/open-access" target="_blank">open access</a> online repositories. These repositories are also searched in swisscovery and linked directly to the full text of the publication.</p>
                    <p><strong>Full text articles and more (CDI):</strong></p>
					<p>The Central Discovery Index (CDI) is a search index and thus the elementary basis of index-based search engines such as Google. A search index can best be compared to a (very) long list that includes all the searchable content. In addition to descriptive information, such as the title or author of a work, this content can also include the full texts of complete books, databases, or journals. In the end, the search engine only searches this list and not the actual data source directly. This has enormous advantages: On the one hand, even with billions of recorded entries, a search of the entire database is possible in just a few seconds. On the other hand, these results can be sorted by "relevance" - results in which the search terms appear more frequently or in a more prominent position (e.g. in the title) are displayed before others with fewer matches. The Central Discovery Index is a search index aggregated by the provider Ex Libris / ProQuest. It contains complete articles from journals, book chapters, book reviews, research data, but also many film and audio documents. The total number of entries is well over 3 billion. The individual swisscovery libraries and regions can decide for themselves which of these contents they would like to have included in the swisscovery search by activating them. You can also select for yourself at any time next to the search line whether you want to perform a search "with" or "without CDI", if the search bandwidth in the Central Discovery Index seems too large to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Courier services and Interlibrary Loan:</strong></p> 
					<p>If you have found a book you are interested in during your research in swisscovery, but you are not able to view or pick it up at the owning library, you have the possibility to have the book delivered directly to your home (CHF 12 / medium, depending on the user group) or to your preferred local library (CHF 6-12 / medium, depending on your user group). For all swisscovery libraries that are connected to the SLSP Courier, this is possible within 48 hours nationwide. In addition, it is also possible to have media from all libraries in Switzerland and abroad delivered by interlibrary loan. For this service, the delivering libraries charge <a href="https://slsp.ch/en/fees" target="_blank">different fees</a> and the delivery usually takes longer.</p>
