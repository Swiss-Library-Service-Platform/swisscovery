                    <p>
                        The Swiss Library Service Platform, along with his subsidiary Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries, with more than
                        <a href="https://slsp.ch/libraries" target="_blank">470 members</a>, is the biggest network of academic and research libraries in Switzerland. Created by libraries, for libraries, it is a joint effort to provide a series of services at the entire country such as, a shared multilingual catalogue of scientific information, a unique representative for e-resources licensing and a performant courier network for physical items sharing.
                    </p>
                    <p>SLSP represents an innovative and significant step forward in the digital evolution of scientific libraries in Switzerland. By managing the cloud-based Alma system, the organisation brings together scientific information stored in libraries across Switzerland. By making this information accessible and easily findable, SLSP contributes to scientific discovery and progress.</p>

                        <h3>SLSP Network<img class="icon_up2" height="20" width="15" src="custom/41SLSP_NETWORK-VU1_UNION/img/help/iconUp.png" /> </h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>SLSP Network is divided in several "zones".  SLSP itself manage the network zone (NZ) called swisscovery, while libraries have been distributed in 29 "institution zones" (IZ).</p>
                    <p>An institution zone (IZ) is a group of libraries that have similar needs. The IZ is a key component in the SLSP system and represents a division that enables synergies and increases efficiency. In SLSP we distinguish two types of institution zone: single entity zones and mixed entity zones.</p>
                    <p>In a single entity zone, most of libraries are legally related to one main entity (for instance a university). In a mixed entity zone, libraries are legally related to different entities (for instance they are grouped together due to geographical considerations)</p>
                    <p>To access the resources of SLSP members, users must access the users' interfaces called "views". In SLSP we have prepared a view for the Network Zone (NZ), a view for every Institution Zone (IZ) and several views for single libraries.</p>
                    <p>Every view has its specifics search scopes, which will return different results when used for the search. The swisscovery network zone contains all records coming from the SLSP libraries, some general external resource (for example e-rara data) and the CDI index. The institution zones views and the library views contain the local inventory of the institution zone / library, general and local external resources and the CDI index.</p>
                    <p>Central Discovery Index (CDI): is a central database of more than 3 billion of records such as: journals articles, e-books, dissertations, conference proceedings, etc.</p>

                        Access to online resources often depends on whether your device is within the network of a licensing university and if you work for or study at this university. Some universities and libraries allow users to access online resources from outside their network using a proxy service. For more information concerning the conditions to access the online resources, you can consult the chapter "Online resources" of this help page,
                        the <a href="https://consortium.ch/?lang=en" target="_blank">Consortium's website</a>  or the website of the library which licenses for the respective resource.
                    </p>
                    <p>These conditions aren't applied to the National licences (for more information see the corresponding chapter of this help page). </p>

This infographic explains where you search while using one of the two.  In certain institution zones or library views it is possible to find additional custom search profiles created by the institution zone / library. </p>

                    <p><strong>My library:</strong> Includes the local inventory of the institution zone / library + external resources loaded in this institution zone (general and local) + CDI (CDI could also be used as a separate search profile). This search profile is always named after the institution. </p>
                    <p><strong>All SLSP libraries:</strong> All records of the SLSP network + general external resources + CDI   </p>
                    <p><strong>Custom Search Profile:</strong> Some institution zones / libraries prepared their own search profiles including Custom Local Data Scope(s). </p>
                    <p><strong>Central Discovery Index (CDI):</strong> Is a central database comprehensive of thousands of sources for a total of more than 3 billion of records such as: journals articles, e-books, dissertations, conference proceedings, patents, reports, government document, images and videos. Depending on the institution zone / library view, the CDI is searchable in the "My Library" search profile, in a separate search profile or both. </p>
                    <p><strong>General External resources:</strong> swisscovery has been enriched by adding general electronic external resources. A detailed list of these resources is available here. </p>
                    <p><strong>Local external resources:</strong> In addition to the general external resource, some institution zones also provide local external resource. </p>
